#a very simple prototype of two players panel ball game

![demo](https://github.com/jaclass/some-mini-projects/blob/master/two-players-phaser-game/assets/demo.PNG?raw=true)

#### basic description:
I use [socket.io](https://socket.io/) to build a server and [phaser.js](https://phaser.io/) for game engine. The positions of ball are synchronized in server to avoid inconsistency.

#### install and run
Node.js is required for addressing dependency
> npm install

Then, run the server.js through node
> node server.js

Finally, open two clients in your web browser.
